# Internship-finder

The main purpose of this application is to help students find internships in just a few steps.

Why this application is important?

This application is to help the search for internships based on student’s qualifications and criteria. As we all know applying to an internship is an important for a successful career in the future, and having a good internship in college can open doors to other opportunities. But it can be very tedious to find internship that meet your needs and provide sponsorship especially for international students. “Internship finder” lets a student create an account, and then search for internship in simple steps, and then apply through the company’s link provided.
The main functionalities of Application 
The proposed application will have the followings: 
1. Login Window. The login window allows the user to login to his/her account in case that user has an account already. If the user does not have account, a message should appear to tell the user that s/he needs to create an account. 
2. Create an Account Window. This window asks the user to enter her/his personal information: username, password, date of birth, age, gender, etc. 
	3. Home Window. This window contains two main fields: 
	a. Button that allows the student to search for internships.
	b. Listview of shortlisted internships
4. Internship Search Window: The window has search filters that allows the user to search for specific internships. Users can search based on company name, location, position, and period of the internship. 
5. Results Window: This returns the results of the search results. It allows user to select an internship and send it to shortlist or apply to it. To apply to an internship user will be provided the link to company’s website, which would be partial window on the results window, which would act as a 2-in-1 window.
Brief Description of Your Data File 
I made my own csv file because this data is not publicly available. The csv file would contain a column each for company name, position, city, state, offered semester(s), sponsorship availability, link to apply at.
